# calecopal: a California-inspired package of color palettes.

Code from Karthik Ram's `wesanderson` package, linked [here](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson). Palettes compiled by A. Bui, H. Lowman, and A.S. Guerra. Ecosystems were chosen based on University of California Natural Reserve System [sites](https://ucnrs.org/find-a-reserve/ecosystems/), which span nearly all of California's many landscapes. Pictures were taken from image search/personal collections, and colors were generated using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) and [imagecolorpicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/).
